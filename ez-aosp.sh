# EZ AOSP description
  whiptail --title "EZ AOSP" --msgbox "This tool is meant to help set up an AOSP (Android Open Source Project) build environment as painlessly and user-friendly as possible. By doing this, contributions to AOSP and custom aftermarket AOSP firmware, also known as 'custom ROMs' will be much easier to make. Please be aware that this program currently only supports mx. Other mx versions and Linux distributions will be added in the future. \n\nContributions to this program can be made here: github.com/mikecriggs/ez-aosp" 20 70
